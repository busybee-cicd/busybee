## Requirements
- Node.js 8 or higher. The library relies on async/await syntax only supported in the lastest NodeJS version. However, I plan to transpile the library to support older NodeJS versions.

## Quickstart
```
npm install -g git+https://502740163@github.build.ge.com/212589146/feeny.git
feeny init
feeny --help
```

## About

### What it is
Feeny will coordinate the steps necessary to run your Functional Tests and is unopinionated
when it comes to deciding how your environments are started, when you deem an environment
is ready, what technologies you're using, etc. Feeny is only concerned with the following:  

1. Figure out how many Test Sets we're dealing with. Each test set will run against its own environment
so if you don't want tests to interact with one another, separate them into Test Sets.
2. Spin up a separate environment for each test set.
3. Run the tests against each environment.
4. Spin down each environment.
5. Report results.

### What it isn't
It is not a magic bullet. You still have to write tests.
It does not include the implementation of how to spin up your environment or where you environment
lives, though we provide examples of how to accomplish this. It is up to you to provide a shell script that does the dirty work of launching an env and then
returning "success" back to Feeny so that Feeny can continue on to the next step.

## helpful information
- env.startScript is passed `envId`, `apiHost`, `port`, `testDirectoryPath` as arguments.
- env.stopScript is passed  `envId` as an argument.

## Configuration
By default, Feeny will look from configuration in feeny/config.json

### restApi
- `protocol` - rest api protocol
- `host` - rest api host
- `port` - rest api port
- `root` - root context of all api calls ie) /v1.
- `defaultRequestOpts` - an object representing request params to be sent by default on
each api request. defaultRequestOpts can be overridden with-in individual tests.
- `testSetConf` - an array of testSet configurations. only required if assigning tests to one or more
testSets.

## Todo
- test adapters
  - support https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman#using-newman-as-a-nodejs-module ?
    - may just want a commandline opt for running postman tests and another for converting them to Feeny formay since Feeny supports additional features like sets and indexes.
- support healthcheck script
- transpile to support older version of node
- decide how to handle mocks of errors. add a { mock: true } property to the test config?
- support testSets with state
- support behavior,  delays in mocks (timeout)
